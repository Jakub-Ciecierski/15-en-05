\section{Methodology and technology }
We choose Agile development to provide a regular and iterative work flow. \\
\\
For technology we have chosen .NET C\#, a powerful tool which we would like to explore even further.

\section{Algorithm}
The algorithm uses cluster analysis to predict number of vehicles that should be used in the optimal solution. In other words, the problem of Multiple TSP is split into few single TSP problems. The basic flow of the algorithm looks as follows

\begin{itemize}
	\item Divide 
	Combine location coordinates (e.g. (x,y) 2D) and time(z) into 3d (x,y,z) array
	Compute Cluster evaluation e.g. prediction strength.
	Each of k clusters is assumed to be one different vehicle. 
	If there are more clusters than vehicles, take $k = num\_vehicles$
	
	\item Solve
	Now mTSP has been partitioned into k TSP problems.
	K TSP's are computed.
	
	\item Merge
	Combine costs
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Divide}        
Algorithms used in the divide part.

	\subsubsection{K-means}
	Most common algorithm for constructing clusters

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Randomly select k centers
		\item Group points to their closest centroids
		\item Update centroids by computing mean
		\item Repeat 2. and 3. untill convergence
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsubsection{Prediction Strength}


	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Split training data set into: Learning and Test sets.
		
		\item Compute k-means for both sets.
		
		\item Computes the co-membership of 
		each Test cluster in respect to Learnings clusters.
			{\bf Definition: co-membership}
			Let data be a set of n elements, then co-membership 
			is an n by n matrix with (i,j)th element equal to 1
			if i and j fall into the same cluster from the clusters set, 0 otherwise.
			The clusters and data can come from different samples (of the same population) 
			
		\item Compute strength of each Test cluster and find the minimum value.
	\end{enumerate}	

	
\subsection{Solve}
Travelling Salesman Problem with Triangle Inequality.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Extract locations points from provided benchmark.
		\item Convert [1]'s points into undirect graph with wages based on distances.
		\item Calculate Prim's Algorithm with root set to a car's starting position.
		\item Recursively traverse minimum spanning tree from [3] in PRE-ORDER fashion.
		\item Create hamiltonian cycle by connecting first and last element from [4]'s sequence.
		\item Pack [5] and its length (in terms of graph's wages).
		\item Return [6].
	\end{enumerate}	

\subsection{Merge}
The final solution is a union of partial solutions.
